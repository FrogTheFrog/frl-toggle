# frl-toggle ![Status](https://github.com/FrogTheFrog/frl-toggle/actions/workflows/publish.yaml/badge.svg)

App for Windows to toggle Nvidia's Frame Rate Limiter (FRL) via command line

# How to use

Run the app in terminal for usage instruction, but in case you're lazy:
```
  Usage example:
    frltoggle status    prints the current FRL value. Value 0 means it's disabled.
    frltoggle 0         turns off the framerate limiter.
    frltoggle 60        sets the FPS limit to 60 (allowed values are [0, 1023]).
```
